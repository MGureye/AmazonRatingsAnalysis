Amazon Ratings Analysis (Java)

This project began as a class assignment in Java programming, where I practiced file input/output and basic data handling. I decided to expand it into a more finalized project to demonstrate skills in data cleaning and statistical analysis. 

The program reads a dataset of Amazon bestseller ratings from a CSV file, filters out invalid rows, calculates key statistics, and outputs a cleaned dataset. Itâ€™s a small but practical example of how academic work can be reframed into something closer to real-world analysis.

Features:
1. Data Cleaning: Skips over invalid or missing entries.
2. Statistical Analysis: Computes average, median, and standard deviation.
3. CSV Handling: Reads from a raw CSV file and writes results to a cleaned CSV.
4. Reusable Code: Modular Java methods that could be expanded for larger datasets.

Sample Output:
--- Amazon Ratings Analysis ---
Valid ratings loaded: [4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.8, 4.9, 3.7, 4.2]
Total ratings: 7
Average rating: 4.01
Median rating: 4.20
Std Dev: 0.81

How to Run:
Compile: javac AmazonRatingsAnalysis.java
Run: java AmazonRatingsAnalysis

Reflection:
This project started as a classroom exercise but taught me how to connect programming to practical analysis tasks. By cleaning data and generating statistics, I saw how even a small program can model real-world analyst experiences. Expanding and documenting it helped me practice turning coursework into portfolio-ready projects.
